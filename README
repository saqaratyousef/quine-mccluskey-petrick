Quine-McCluskey-Petrick logic minimizer

I think google code provides the GPL license.

[Some =)] sloppy work to meet deadline, but correct results.
If all the printing handling is stripped, I think the solution is pretty efficient.

compile with gcc:
	g++ -o qmp qmp.cpp

run:
	./qmp

waits for input until EOF:
	#variables [list of minterms] [d [list of don't cares]] + Enter + Ctrl-D (Ctrl-Z win)

ex:	3 0 1 2 7 5 6	{3 vars, F = sum m(0,1,2,5,6,7) }
	Ctrl-D linux

ex:	4 9 12 13 15 d 1 4 5 7 8 11 14
	Ctrl-Z win
	{4 vars, F = sum m(9,12,13,15) + sum d(1,4,5,7,8,11,14) }

or you can save the inputs in a file:
	./qmp < file

or you can hardcode the funcion and let the computer evaluated, then:
	./f | ./qmp
